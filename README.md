## Step 1: Create a publicly accessible MYSQL database in RDS

We need to create a publicly accessible RDS instance with minimal cost to hold our application data

## Security Group for MYSQL traffic

- On AWS Management Console navigate to `EC2` > `Security Groups` > `Create security group`

- Add an inbound rule for `MYSQL` from `Anywhere` (basically Protocol: `TCP`, Port: `3306`, Source: `0.0.0.0/0`)

- Leave everything else as it's and click create

## Create an RDS Instance

**Please follow this section very carefully to avoid DB problems in the upcoming stages**

- On AWS Management Console navigate to `RDS` > `Databases` > `Create database`

- In the first card choose `Standard Create`, and in **Engine** options choose `MYSQL` with the **default** version

  ![](./assests/rds-2.png)

- In **Templates** choose `Free tier`, and you'll see that you're restricted to `Single DB instance` in the next card

  ![](./assests/rds-3.png)

- In Settings choose a name for your instance identifier (`test-database`)

- Under **credentials** choose a username and a password (username: `admin`, password: Check `Auto generate a password`) or input your custom password

- In **Instance configuration** you can select any available option (`db.t4g.micro`)

   ![](./assests/rds-4.png)

- In Storage make sure to **uncheck** `Enable storage autoscaling`

   ![](./assests/rds-5.png)

- **Important**: In **Connectivity** make sure you choose the correct values

  - **VPC**: `Default VPC`
  - **Subnet group**: `default`
  - **Public access**: `Yes`
  - **VPC Security Group**: `Choose existing`
    - **Remove** `default`
    - **Add** the security group created in the previous step (`Public-MYSQL-RDS`)
  - **Availability Zone**: `No preference`
  - **Additional configuration**:
    - **Database port: `3306`**

Next, select VPC if you ave created any previously OR use default VPC, and choose any of the public subnet, Enable Auto-Assigned Public IP, and finally Create a Security Group keeping the default settings then click on Launch Instance.

## Security Group for EC2 instance traffic

- On AWS Management Console navigate to `EC2` > `Security Groups` > `Create security group`

- Add an inbound rule for `All TCP` from `Anywhere` (basically Protocol: `TCP`, Port: `0-65536`, Source: `0.0.0.0/0`)

- Leave everything else as it's and click create
